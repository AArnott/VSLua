# Contributing

Visual Studio Extension for Lua is currently accepting contributions in the form of bug fixes, features or design changes.

Your pull request should:

* Include a description of what your change intends to do
* Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the **master** branch
    * Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
* It is desirable, but not necessary, for the tests to pass at each commit
* Have clear commit messages
    * e.g. "Refactor feature", "Fix issue", "Add tests for issue"
* To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration
